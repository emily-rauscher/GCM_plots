# GCM_plots
This Repository contains python functions and notebooks designed to replicated the original IDL code for generating outputs from RM-GCM


-> Each notebook replicates an old IDL script, with an associated .py function

-> Each notebook (hopefully) contains detailed instructions for what each necessary input is

Note: since git sees a "change" to notebooks when you just run them and don't actually change them, you can use git stash to "hide" that from git before you do a git pull
