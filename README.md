# GCM_plots
This Repository contains python functions and notebooks designed to replicated the original IDL code for generating outputs from RM-GCM


-> Each notebook replicates an old IDL script, with an associated .py function

-> Each notebook (hopefully) contains detailed instructions for what each necessary input is
